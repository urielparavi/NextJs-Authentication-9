## ðŸ“¦ Installing Lucia Auth with SQLite

To add user authentication to the app, we use [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) â€” a modern, secure, and developer-friendly authentication library.

We'll also use the SQLite adapter to store user and session data in a local database.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install lucia @lucia-auth/adapter-sqlite
```
